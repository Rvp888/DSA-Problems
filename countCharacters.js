// Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters:

// You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

// A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

// Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

// Example:

// Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
