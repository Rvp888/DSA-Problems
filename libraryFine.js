// Library Fine:

// Problem:
// Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a 
// program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

// 1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
// 2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as 
//    the expected return date, the fine = 15 x (the number of days late).
